<h2 align="center">Welcome to Novella ðŸ‘‹</h2>


> Novella is a book-sharing platform where any logged-in user can lend out or borrow a book for free. It connects people who want to lend their books away to people who want to read a book without buying it. It breaks the financial barrier that discourages people from expanding their knowledge.
